The [xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of the
[SiFive RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (Intel 32/64-bit),
**macOS** (Intel 64-bit) and **GNU/Linux** (Intel 32/64-bit, Arm 64-bit).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

:::note

Due to memory limitations during the build, there is no Arm 32-bit image.

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- Intel GNU/Linux 32/64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.15** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 12 or later, Debian 8 or later, RedHat/CentOS 7 later,
  Fedora 20 or later, etc)
- Arm GNU/Linux 64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.23** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 16 or later, Debian 9 or later, RedHat/CentOS 8 or later,
  Fedora 24 or later, etc); (there is no Arm 32-bit image!);
- Intel Windows 32/64-bit: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- x64 macOS: 10.13 or later

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on various platforms
are presented in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

## Compliance

The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC generally follows the official
SiFive RISC-V GCC [releases](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases)),
with as little differences as possible.

The current version is based on:

- SiFive RISC-V GCC release **{frontMatter.sifive_version}** from {frontMatter.sifive_date},
and includes the SiFive extensions, including the RVV vector support.

## Changes

There are no functional changes.

### Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments

### newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

### nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

### Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail." %}

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

:::

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- the SiFive v2020.12.0 release no longer includes libraries without
  the C (compressed) instructions; the list of multi-libs was expanded with
  28 more libraries in v10.2.0-1.2
- due to the very large number of instructions added by the vector support
  (~70K), the compiler sources became too large and it was not possible to build the Arm 32-bit image
  ([#229](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/issues/229))
- the archive size got too big for the Windows 32-bit node to handle, and
  `xpm install` may fail with _RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed_;
  the 64-bit systems are not affected.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and Intel & Arm GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

```

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
