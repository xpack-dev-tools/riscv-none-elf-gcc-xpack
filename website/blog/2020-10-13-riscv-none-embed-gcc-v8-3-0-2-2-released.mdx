Version **8.3.0-2.2** is a maintenance release of the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC**, to fix a regression bug in binutils 2.32 affecting the parsing of LENGTH and ORIGIN in linker scripts.

<!-- truncate -->

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

The [xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack)
is the **xPack** distribution of the
[SiFive RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases).

There are binaries for **x64 Windows**,
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

Starting with 8.2.0-2, the xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC (formerly
GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V GCC) follows
the official [SiFive releases](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases),
with as little differences as possible.

This release is based on the
[v2020.04.0-Toolchain.Only](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2020.04.0-Toolchain.Only)
release, and includes the SiFive extensions.

## Changes

### Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments

### newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

### nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

### Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail.

:::

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

It is mandatory to have **exactly** this version installed, otherwise
GDB will not start properly.

For this it is recommended to install the binaries provided by
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
not those available in the distribution, since they may be incomplete, for
example those in Ubuntu/Debian, which split the Python system library into
multiple packages.

On GNU/Linux, the recommended way is to build is from sources, and
install locally:

```bash
python3_version="3.7.9"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Downloads"
curl -L --fail -o "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz" https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${python3_version}/Python-${python3_version}.tgz
rm -rf "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Work"
cd "${HOME}/Work"
tar xzf "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz"
cd "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
bash ./configure --prefix="${HOME}/opt"
make
make altinstall
```

To run GDB with this version of Python, use a script to set the proper
environment, like:

```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}/opt/bin"
cat <<'__EOF__' > "${HOME}/opt/bin/riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
PYTHONPATH="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import os; import sys; print(os.pathsep.join(sys.path))')" \
PYTHONHOME="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)')" \
riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3 "$@"
__EOF__
chmod +x "${HOME}/opt/bin/riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3.sh"
```

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

## Bug fixes

- binutils 2.32 introduced a regression bug
[24289](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24289) which
prevented MEMORY regions to use LENGTH and ORIGIN. The bug was fixed in
binutils 2.33.1 via commit
[912ebfa](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=912ebfa0d748b4a762dbc4311364c38692c7f626). In this release, on top
of the SiFive sources, this commit was applied via git cherry pick,
and LENGTH and ORIGIN are now recognised as expected.

## Known problems

- the GDB binary with Python support was built with version 3.7,
  and require exactly this version in order to run properly;
  fixed in 8.3.0-2.3 which includes the Python run-time;
- GDB may issue the following warning, _riscv-none-embed-gdb: warning:
  Couldn't determine a path for the index cache directory._;
  it is a known problem, caused when trying to create the cache
  folder (`$HOME/.cache/gdb` or `$HOME/Library/Caches/gdb`);
- the archive size got too big for the Windows 32-bit node to handle, and
  `xpm install` fails with _RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed_.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/735326282)
- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/735326376)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.14.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
