## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on
various platforms are presented in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com)
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is based on the
[v2019.08.0](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2019.08.0)
release, and includes the SiFive extensions (like CLIC interrupts and a an
even larger multi-lib set).

The following commits (from [sifive/freedom-tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/tree/master/src)) were used:

- the [sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `sifive-binutils-2.32`, commit
[03d23d5](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb/tree/03d23d58701bdd425c613b0be2d458bcde46912b)
from 2 September 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `sifive-gcc-8.3.0`, commit
[e195042](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc/tree/e195042babe2dc30d9fabb88d336d8c8679b3702)
from from 7 Aug 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib) project, the `master` branch,
commit [0d24a86](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib/tree/0d24a86822a5ee73d6a6aa69e2a0118aa1e35204)
from 9 July 2019

GDB was upstreamed and does not require SiFive specific patches,
so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `9b40759` commit from
28 Feb 2019.

## Bug fixes

- [[#3]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/issues/3)
Due to an omission in the build scripts, the content of the `libgcov`
library was mostly empty; the script was fixed and now the library has the
expected content.
- [[#4]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/issues/4)
Due to a bug in the build scripts, the Windows binaries included two
copies of the `docs` folder, one in root and one in the `share` folder;
the script was fixed and now there is only one copy in `share/docs`.

## Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments
- `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` was added to the list of multi-libs
- the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, is included
- experimental support for Python in GDB was added

## newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

## nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

## Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail." %}

## Known problems

- [[#5]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/issues/5)
the `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py` fails to start on Ubuntu (and possibly
other Debian) systems, it fails with a message like:
```console
$ PYTHONHOME=/usr PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7 riscv-none-embed-gdb-py --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 554, in <module>
    main()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 536, in main
    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 272, in addusersitepackages
    user_site = getusersitepackages()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 247, in getusersitepackages
    user_base = getuserbase() # this will also set USER_BASE
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py", line 237, in getuserbase
    USER_BASE = get_config_var('userbase')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 587, in get_config_var
    return get_config_vars().get(name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 533, in get_config_vars
    _init_posix(_CONFIG_VARS)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py", line 417, in _init_posix
    from _sysconfigdata import build_time_vars
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.py", line 6, in <module>
    from _sysconfigdata_nd import *
ImportError: No module named _sysconfigdata_nd
```

The problem is caused by gdb-py not being able to locate the Python
system libraries, split into multiple packages and installed in multiple
folders.

The workaround is to pass the Python environment to gdb-py:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'import os; import sys; print(os.pathsep.join(sys.path))')" \
PYTHONHOME="$(python -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)')"
```

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6
  Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a
  CentOS 6 Docker container
- x64 macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.14.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
