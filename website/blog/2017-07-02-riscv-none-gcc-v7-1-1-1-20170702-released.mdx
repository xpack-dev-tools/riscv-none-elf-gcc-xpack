## Compliance

This release closely follows the official [RISC-V distribution](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) maintained by [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com).

The current version is based on project [riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain), tag v20170612 (commit [f5fae1c](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/tree/f5fae1c27b2365da773816ddcd92f533867f28ec)) from June 12th, which depends on the following:

* the [riscv/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) project, commit [16210e6](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/commit/16210e6270e200cd4892a90ecef608906be3a130) from from May 15th, 2017
* the [riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb) project, commit [3f21b5c](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb/commit/3f21b5c9675db61ef5462442b6a068d4a3da8aaf) from May 5th, 2017
* the [riscv/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib) project, commit [ccd8a0a](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib/commit/ccd8a0a4ffbbc00400892334eaf64a1616302b35) from May 2nd, 2017

The supported architectures (`-march=`) are:

* rv32i[m][a][f[d]][c]
* rv32g[c]
* rv64i[m][a][f[d]][c]
* rv64g[c]

The supported ABIs (`-mabi=`) are:

* ilp32 (32-bit, soft-float)
* ilp32f (32-bit with single-precision in registers and double in memory, niche use only)
* ilp32d (32-bit, hard-float)
* lp64 (64-bit long and pointers, soft-float)
* lp64f (64-bit long and pointers, with single-precision in registers and double in memory, niche use only)
* lp64d (64-bit long and pointers, hard-float).

The supported libraries are:

```console
march=rv32i/mabi=ilp32
march=rv32im/mabi=ilp32
march=rv32iac/mabi=ilp32
march=rv32imac/mabi=ilp32
march=rv32imafc/mabi=ilp32f
march=rv64imac/mabi=lp64
march=rv64imafdc/mabi=lp64d
```

Please note that not all possible combinations of architecture and ABI have libraries.

## Changes

Compared to the original RISC-V version, there are no functional changes; the **same architecture and API options** are supported, and the **same combinations of libraries** (derived from newlib) are provided.

## newlib-nano

The only notable addition is support for **newlib-nano**, using the `--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be added to both compile and link time (the next release of the GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins will add support for this).

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

The _nano_ versions of the libraries are compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medlow`, while the regular versions are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`.

## Documentation

Another addition compared to the SiFive distribution is the presence of the documentation, including the PDF manuals for all tools.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided. For Windows and macOS, separate installable and plain archives are provided. For Windows and GNU/Linux, both 32/64-bit binaries are provided.

Instructions on how to install them are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate [gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build) project.

## Known problems

[2017-09-14 update] Soon after this release was used in real projects, it was discovered that the general configuration of the toolchain was intended more to applications that include a kernel-like environment, and less to bare-metal environments. The main problems are:

* the `newlib` configuration does not use the `underscore` syscall function, but the direct names (like `write()` instead of `_write()`), calls that are always forwarded to `libgloss`
* the compiler configuration always links `libgloss` to the application; `libgloss` implements all system calls via traps to a unix like kernel.

Both problems were fixed in the [v7.1.1-2-20170912](/blog/2017/09/13/riscv-none-gcc-v7-1-1-2-20170912-released/) release.
