Version **8.2.0-3.1** is a new release of the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC**, following SiFive release from May 2019.

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com)
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is based on the
[v2019.05.0](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2019.05.0)
release, and includes the SiFive extensions (like CLIC interrupts and a
larger multi-lib set).

The following commits (from [sifive/freedom-tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/tree/master/src)) were used:

- the [sifive/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `sifive-gcc-8.2.0`, commit
[242abcaff6](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc/tree/242abcaff697d0a1ea12dccc975465e1bfeb8331)
from from 5 April 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `sifive-binutils-2.32`, commit
[164267155c](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb/tree/164267155c96f91472a539ca78ac919993bc5b4e)
from 28 February 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib) project,
commit [42c2e3fb9f](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib/tree/42c2e3fb9f557d59b76d1a64bb6fb32707ff4530)
from 17 November 2018

GDB was upstreamed and does not require SiFive specific patches,
so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `9b40759` commit from
28 Feb 2019.

## Supported libraries

The supported libraries are:

```console
$ riscv-none-embed-gcc -print-multi-lib
.;
rv32e/ilp32e;@march=rv32e@mabi=ilp32e
rv32em/ilp32e;@march=rv32em@mabi=ilp32e

rv64imafdc/lp64d;@march=rv64imafdc@mabi=lp64d
```

## Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments
- `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` was added to the list of multi-libs
- the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, is included

## newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

## nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

## Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail.

:::

## Known problems

- support for Python scripting is experimental and `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py`
does not start properly on some systems.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a CentOS 6
  Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 7.4, running in a
  CentOS 6 Docker container
- x64 macOS: most binaries were built with GCC 7.4, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5; GDB cannot be compiled with GCC, so Apple
  clang was used.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
