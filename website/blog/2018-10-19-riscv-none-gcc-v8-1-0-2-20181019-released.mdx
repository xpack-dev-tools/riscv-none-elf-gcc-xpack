## Compliance

This release closely follows the official
[RISC-V distribution](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) maintained by
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com).

It is more or less similar to the 20180928 release, except support for
SiFive specific CLIC interrupts, which was not included.

The following commits were used:

- the [riscv/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `riscv-gcc-8.1.0`, commit
[3c148a7e6ea](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/commit/3c148a7e6ea1379e3a8e8b5350ec03a72e5d4137)
from from July 3rd, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `riscv-binutils-2.30`, commit
[0d2fb1b7ff](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-binutils-gdb/commit/0d2fb1b7ff9b94e40352306f1f8857b863c6f787)
from Aug 11th, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib) project,
commit [77e11e180](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-newlib/commit/77e11e1800f57cac7f5468b2bd064100a44755d4)
from July 12th, 2018

GDB is a bit special, since it is only partly upstreamed and the RISC-V repos
are no longer updated, so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `7dd36a6f1c` commit from
Aug 23rd, 2018 (same as the SiFive release).

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf`
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* a newer `newlib` was included, which supports the 'underscore' syscall functions
* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multi-libs
* support for `newlib-nano` was added
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker
containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems
