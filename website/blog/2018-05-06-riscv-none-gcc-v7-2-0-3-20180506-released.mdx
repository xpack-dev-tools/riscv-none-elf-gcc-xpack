## Compliance

All **GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC** releases are based on the
official [RISC-V source files](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc)
maintained by [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com).

By the date of this release, the `riscv-gcc-7.3.0` branch is not yet
stable, thus the current version is still based on GCC 7.2, using the
following commits:

- the [riscv/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `riscv-gcc-7.2.0`, commit
[36e932c](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/commit/36e932c683490ddfa5225ad8d842b002a8a74ed4)
from from Jan 16th, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `riscv-binutils-2.29`, commit
[f60a065](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-binutils-gdb/commit/f60a065a25cc54169a34ed351931097a44703a5c)
from May 3rd, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib) project,
commit [1e50b13](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-newlib/commit/1e50b130fe1514a96eb4dc12f4a661d14f5cf6d4)
from Feb 27th, 2018

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf`
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* a newer `newlib` was included, which supports the 'underscore' syscall functions
* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multi-libs
* support for `newlib-nano` was added
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker
containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

* due to a missing option in the build script, the libraries are not
functional for 64-bit devices, the build fails (fixed in 7.2.0-4):

```
locale.c:(.text.__locale_ctype_ptr+0x8): relocation truncated to fit: R_RISCV_HI20 against `.LANCHOR0'
```

* the `libnosys` library does not export the correct underscore symbols.
