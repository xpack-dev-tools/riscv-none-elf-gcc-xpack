## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com)
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is similar to the SiFive 2019-02 release, including support for
SiFive specific CLIC interrupts.

The following commits were used:

- the [sifive/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `sifive-gcc-8.2.0`, commit
[242abcaff6](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc/tree/242abcaff697d0a1ea12dccc975465e1bfeb8331)
from from 5 April 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `sifive-binutils-2.32`, commit
[164267155c](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb/tree/164267155c96f91472a539ca78ac919993bc5b4e)
from 28 February 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib) project,
commit [42c2e3fb9f](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib/tree/42c2e3fb9f557d59b76d1a64bb6fb32707ff4530)
from 17 November 2018

GDB was upstreamed and does not require SiFive specific patches,
so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `c8aa0bb` commit from
28 Feb 2019.

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf`
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* a newer `newlib` was included, which supports the 'underscore' syscall functions
* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multi-libs
* support for `newlib-nano` was added
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker
containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build)
project.

## Known problems

* on macOS, the `riscv-none-embed-gdb` program fails when certain
  commands are used; this is a known GDB build problem, and will
  be fixed in the next release.
