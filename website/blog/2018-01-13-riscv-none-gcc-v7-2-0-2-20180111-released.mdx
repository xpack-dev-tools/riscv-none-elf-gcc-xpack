## Compliance

All **GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC** releases are based on the official [RISC-V source files](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) maintained by [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com).

The current version is based on the following commits:

- the [riscv/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc) project, commit [5bf0f1d](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/commit/5bf0f1db0ed4dd3e0cdd9395e7b258234ac976d9) from from Jan 8th, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb) project, commit [5d812b7](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-binutils-gdb/commit/5d812b72c943d8cfa08d67baed73d1a64eb943e7) from Jan 9th, 2018
- the [riscv/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib) project, commit [32a3de0](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-newlib/commit/32a3de0bba1535fc1ca0d8dfae147d1dacaf0979) from Dec 21st, 2017

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf` toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* a newer `newlib` was included, which supports the 'underscore' syscall functions
* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multi-libs
* support for `newlib-nano` was added
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit), and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

The toolchain is also available as an [xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc) and can be conveniently installed with [`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate [gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build) project.
