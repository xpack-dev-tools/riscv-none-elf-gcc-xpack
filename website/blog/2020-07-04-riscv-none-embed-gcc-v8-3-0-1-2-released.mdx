Version **8.3.0-1.2** is a maintenance release of the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC**, that packs the SiFive release from August 2019, and **adds support for running on Arm platforms**, like **Raspberry Pi**.

<!-- truncate -->

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

This is the **xPack** distribution of the
[SiFive RISC-V GCC](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases).

There are separate binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and
**GNU/Linux**, 32/64-bit.

Starting with this version, support for 32/64-bit **Arm GNU/Linux** platforms,
like **Raspberry Pi**, was added.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com)
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is based on the
[v2019.08.0](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2019.08.0)
release, and includes the SiFive extensions (like CLIC interrupts and a an
even larger multi-lib set).

The following commits (from [sifive/freedom-tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/tree/master/src)) were used:

- the [sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `sifive-binutils-2.32`, commit
[03d23d5](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb/tree/03d23d58701bdd425c613b0be2d458bcde46912b)
from 2 September 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `sifive-gcc-8.3.0`, commit
[e195042](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc/tree/e195042babe2dc30d9fabb88d336d8c8679b3702)
from from 7 Aug 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib) project, the `master` branch,
commit [0d24a86](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib/tree/0d24a86822a5ee73d6a6aa69e2a0118aa1e35204)
from 9 July 2019

GDB was upstreamed and does not require SiFive specific patches,
so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `9b40759` commit from
28 Feb 2019.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Improvements

Compared to the original SiFive version, the **same architecture and API**
options are supported, and there are minimal functional changes

- `libgloss` was removed from the list of libraries always linked to the
  application, since it issues `ECALL`
  instructions that fail in bare metal environments
- `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` was added to the list of multi-libs
- the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, is included
- experimental support for Python in GDB was added

## newlib-nano

Support for **newlib-nano** is available using the
`--specs=nano.specs` option. For better results, this option must be
added to both compile and link time.

## nosys.specs

If no syscalls are needed, `--specs=nosys.specs` can be used at link
time to provide empty implementations for the POSIX system calls.

## Compile options

The libraries are compiled with `-O2 -mcmodel=medany`. The nano version is
compiled with `-Os -mcmodel=medany`.

:::caution

It is mandatory for the applications to
be compiled with
`-mcmodel=medany`, otherwise the link will fail.

:::

## Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
two separate binaries,
`riscv-none-embed-gdb-py` with Python 2.7 support,
and `riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3` with
support for Python 3.7.

It is mandatory to have **exactly** these version installed, otherwise
GDB will not start properly.

For this it is recommended to install the binaries provided by
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
not those available in the distribution, since they may be incomplete, for
example those in Ubuntu/Debian, which split the Python system library into
multiple packages.

On GNU/Linux, the recommended way is to build is from sources, and
install locally:

```bash
python3_version="3.7.9"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Downloads"
curl -L --fail -o "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz" https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${python3_version}/Python-${python3_version}.tgz
rm -rf "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
mkdir -p "${HOME}/Work"
cd "${HOME}/Work"
tar xzf "${HOME}/Downloads/Python-${python3_version}.tgz"
cd "${HOME}/Work/Python-${python3_version}"
bash ./configure --prefix="${HOME}/opt"
make
make altinstall
```

To run GDB with this version of Python, use a script to set the proper
environment, like:

```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}/opt/bin"
cat <<'__EOF__' > "${HOME}/opt/bin/riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
PYTHONPATH="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import os; import sys; print(os.pathsep.join(sys.path))')" \
PYTHONHOME="$($HOME/opt/bin/python3.7 -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)')" \
riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3 "$@"
__EOF__
chmod +x "${HOME}/opt/bin/riscv-none-embed-gdb-py3.sh"
```

## Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

:::note

TUI is not available on Windows

:::

## Known problems

- the GDB binaries with Python support were built with version 2.7/3.7,
 and require exactly those versions in order to run properly.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/704863198)
- [test xPack RISC-V Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/builds/704865736)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.14.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.
