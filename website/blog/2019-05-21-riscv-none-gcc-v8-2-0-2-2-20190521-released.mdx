## Compliance

Starting with v8.2.0-2, this distribution closely follows the official
[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com)
[Freedom Tools](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools) distribution.

This release is similar to the SiFive 2019-02 release, including support for
SiFive specific CLIC interrupts.

The following commits were used:

- the [sifive/riscv-gcc](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc) project,
branch `sifive-gcc-8.2.0`, commit
[242abcaff6](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-gcc/tree/242abcaff697d0a1ea12dccc975465e1bfeb8331)
from from 5 April 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb)
project, branch `sifive-binutils-2.32`, commit
[164267155c](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-binutils-gdb/tree/164267155c96f91472a539ca78ac919993bc5b4e)
from 28 February 2019
- the [sifive/riscv-newlib](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib) project,
commit [42c2e3fb9f](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-newlib/tree/42c2e3fb9f557d59b76d1a64bb6fb32707ff4530)
from 17 November 2018

GDB was upstreamed and does not require SiFive specific patches,
so the current build uses
`git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`, the `c8aa0bb` commit from
28 Feb 2019.

## Improvements

All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the `riscv64-unknown-elf`
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:

* a newer `newlib` was included, which supports the 'underscore' syscall functions
* the mandatory reference to `libgloss` in the linker configuration was removed
* the `march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f` library was added to the list of multi-libs
* support for `newlib-nano` was added
* the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the project [README](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack).

The toolchain is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc)
and can be conveniently installed with
[`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
```

This installs the latest available version.

For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker
containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build)
project.

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build/tree/master/tests/eclipse)
available in the build project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by SiFive, the
long and complex tests performed by SiFive to validate their release were not
executed again.

## Known problems

* none (so far).
