- rename the version
  folder, by replacing a dash with a space; this will test paths with spaces;
  on Windows the current paths always use spaces, so renaming is not needed
- clone this repo locally; on Windows use the Git console

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools && \
git clone \
  --branch xpack-develop \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack.git
```

- check version:

```sh
.../riscv-none-elf-gcc-14.1.0-1.1/bin/riscv-none-elf-gcc --version
riscv-none-elf-gcc (xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC x86_64) 14.1.0
```

- in a separate workspace, Import → General → Existing Projects into Workspace
  the Eclipse projects available in the
  `tests/eclipse` folder of the build repo; more details in the
  [README.md](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/tests/eclipse/README.md)
- define the **Eclipse** → **Preferences...** → **MCU** →
  **Workspace RISC-V Toolchain path** to use the `Downloads`
  temporary location
- to test the compiler: for all projects
  - remove all build folders, or **Clean all**
  - build all configs, with the hammer, in `riscv-h1b-fs`
  - build all configs, with the hammer, in `riscv-h1b-fs-lib`; this should
    also run the builds in `riscv-static-lib`
- to test the debugger: for all OpenOCD debug configurations
  - start the OpenOCD debug session,
  - single step a few lines (Step Over)
  - start continuous run (Resume)
  - halt (Suspend)
  - start (Resume)
  - stop (Terminate)
  - (don't miss the LTO cases, since in the past they had problems)
- to test the Python debugger, start it with `--version`
