## Using riscv-none-elf-gcc in testing

In addition to integrating into regular development environments,
like Eclipse, GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC can be used for building
unit tests, in CI/CD environments.

### CMake example

The easiest way to build automated tests is with CMake in xPack applications.

For CMake cross-build projects, it is necessary to pass a
`-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
with the path to the toolchain definition.

A possible such file is
[riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/build-helper-xpack/blob/xpack/cmake/toolchains/riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake), part of the
[ÂµOS++](https://micro-os-plus.github.io)
build [helper](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/build-helper-xpack/).

:::tip Windows

Since on Windows the xPack OpenOCD uses `.cmd` forwarders, it is necessary
to explicitly define the extension, later used when invoking `openocd`:

```cmake
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(extension ".cmd")
endif()
```

:::

To run the test, the semihosted application can be directly
executed by QEMU, which provides a good RISC-V emulation.

An example of a unit test running on QEMU is:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_UNIT_TEST)

  add_executable(unit-test)
  set_target_properties(unit-test PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "unit-test")

  // ... definitions to build the application with semihosting support ...

  add_test(
    NAME "unit-test"

    COMMAND qemu-system-riscv32${extension}
    --machine virt
    --cpu rv32
    --kernel unit-test.elf
    --nographic
    -smp 1
    -bios none
    -d unimp,guest_errors
    --semihosting-config enable=on,target=native,arg=unit-test
  )

endif ()
```

In an xPack application, the tests can be invoked by running an xPack action,
like this:

```sh
xpm run test
```

This asssumes that in `package.json` there is an action named `test`
and that all required tools were previously installed:

```json
{
  "...": "...",

  "xpack": {
    "actions": {
      "...": "...",
      "test": "ctest -V"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": "3.26.5-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build": "1.11.1-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv": "8.2.2-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc": "12.3.1-1.2.1"
    }
  }
}
```

The xPack action runs the defined command (`ctest -V` in this case)
in an environment where `xpacks/.bin` is prepended to the PATH, so
the tools installed locally by **xpm** are available and prefered to
possibly other similar tools installed in the system, thus
achieving a good reproducibility.
